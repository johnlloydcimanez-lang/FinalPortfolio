   <p style="font-family:Rockwell;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly had been staring out of her windor for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, 
   and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, 
   and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
   
   <p style="font-family:Rockwell;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. 
   Although many considered her her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llma <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, 
   Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
